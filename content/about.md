Hello! I'm **Hein Thant**, a self-taught developer from *Myanmar*. I build mobile apps, web apps, and half-finished side projects. 

I share my knowledge and thought on this blog. I write about web dev, mobile dev, algorithm, game dev, or anything that comes to my mind actually. I hope you find something useful here.

I'm currently working as a full-time software engineer. I also build side projects and contribute to open-source projects in my free time. My goal is to keep shipping projects that make life easier (or just more fun).

This year, I launched [Comix - Gamified GitHub Commit Tracker](https://comix-dev.vercel.app) where you can earn **GitCoins** for completing  daily commit goal, and compete on a global leaderboard. I've also built an AI assistant, algorithm visualizers, and 2D games. You can check out all my projects at [my personal website](https://heinthantoo.vercel.app) if you're interested.

If you have any suggestions, questions, or just want to say hi, feel free to leave a comment or contact me on hthant00chk@gmail.com. I'd love to hear from you!
